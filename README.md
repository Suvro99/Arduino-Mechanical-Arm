# Arduino-Mechanical-Arm
For a project to build a "Gesture-Controlled Mechanical Arm" based on Arduino.

A Robotic Arm, sometimes referred to as an industrial robot, is often described as a â€˜Mechanical' arm. It is a device that operates in a similar way to a human arm,
with a number of joints that either move along an axis or can rotate in certain directions. In this project a robotic arm was developed that would be able to copy the
gesture of any human arm, using Arduino. 

The file named "arduino codes" under the main secrion contains all the Arduino based coding for this project.
